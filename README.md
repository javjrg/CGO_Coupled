# CGO solutions for coupled conductivity equations

This paper is devoted to study of complex geometrical optics (CGO) solutions to the coupled conductivity equations written in a matrix form $\mathrm{div}\left(Q \cdot \nabla U\right)=0$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ for symmetric, positive definite matrix functions $Q$.
